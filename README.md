# 🐍 Python Intermediate Projects

This repository represents the continuation of my Python learning journey, building upon the foundations established in my previous beginner-level projects.

The main goal of this repository is to further explore, practice, and apply programming logic, core Python concepts, and good coding practices through more complex exercises and problem-solving scenarios, as my understanding of the language evolves.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The topics listed below represent concepts studied and applied throughout the projects, with increasing complexity:

- Conditional logic and nested conditions
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Control flow (`break`, `continue`)
- Functions and modularization
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- String manipulation and formatting
- Input validation
- Basic error handling
- Standard libraries (`random`, `math`, `time`, `datetime`)
- Simple algorithms and logic challenges
