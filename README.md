# 🐍 Python Intermediate Projects

This repository represents the continuation of my Python learning journey, building upon the foundations established in my previous beginner-level projects.

The main goal of this repository is to further explore, practice, and apply programming logic, core Python concepts, and good coding practices through more complex exercises and problem-solving scenarios.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The topics listed below represent concepts studied and applied throughout the projects:

- Conditional logic and nested conditions (Applied in Payment Manager and Data Analyzer)
- Loops (for, while) and Control flow (break, continue)
- Functions and modularization
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- String manipulation and formatting (Advanced f-strings and slicing)
- Input validation and Limiters (Enforcing rules and dynamic constraints)
- Standard libraries (random, math, time, datetime)
- User Experience (UX): Adding delays (time.sleep) and ANSI colors
