# 🐍 Python Intermediate Projects

This repository contains exercises and small projects developed during the intermediate stages of my Python learning journey, based on **Python Mundo 2 and Mundo 3** (Curso em Vídeo).

The focus of this repository is to strengthen programming logic, code organization, and practical problem-solving using more advanced Python concepts.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

The topics listed below represent concepts studied and applied throughout the projects, with increasing complexity:

- Conditional logic and nested conditions
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Control flow (`break`, `continue`)
- Functions and modularization
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- String manipulation and formatting
- Input validation
- Basic error handling
- Standard libraries (`random`, `math`, `time`, `datetime`)
- Simple algorithms and logic challenges

## 📂 Projects

- `number_guessing_game.py` → Number guessing game using loops, conditions, and random logic  
- `menu_system.py` → Menu-driven program using loops and user input  
- `bank_simulator.py` → Simple ATM/bank system simulation with balance control  
- `student_grade_manager.py` → Manages student names and grades using lists and dictionaries  
- `tuple_analysis.py` → Tuple-based data analysis (min, max, count, sorting)  
- `matrix_operations.py` → Basic matrix creation and traversal using nested lists  
- `data_statistics.py` → Collects numeric data and displays statistics (sum, average, max, min)  
- `string_processing.py` → Advanced string analysis and formatting  
- `number_classifier.py` → Classifies numbers based on multiple conditions and rules  

*(Projects are added progressively as new concepts are studied.)*
