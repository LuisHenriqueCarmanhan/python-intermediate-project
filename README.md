# 🐍 Python Intermediate Projects

This repository represents the continuation of my Python learning journey, building upon the foundations established in my previous beginner-level projects.

The main goal of this repository is to further explore, practice, and apply programming logic, core Python concepts, and good coding practices through more complex exercises and problem-solving scenarios, as my understanding of the language evolves.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The topics listed below represent concepts studied and applied throughout the projects, with increasing complexity:

- **Conditional logic and nested conditions** (Applied in Payment Manager and Data Analyzer)
- **Loops (`for`, `while`)** and Control flow (`break`, `continue`)
- **Functions and modularization**
- **Lists, tuples, and dictionaries**
- **String manipulation and formatting** (Advanced f-strings, sanitization with `.split()`/`.join()` and slicing `[::-1]`)
- **Input validation and Limiters** (Enforcing rules like the 12x installment limit and dynamic group sizes)
- **Basic error handling** (Division by zero safety)
- **Standard libraries** (`random`, `math`, `time`, `datetime`)
- **Simple algorithms and logic challenges** (Prime numbers and Palindromes)
- **User Experience (UX):** Adding delays (`time.sleep`), ANSI colors for terminal feedback, and dynamic AI responses
