# 🐍 Python Intermediate Projects

This repository represents the continuation of my Python learning journey, building upon the foundations established in my previous beginner-level projects.

The main goal of this repository is to further explore, practice, and apply programming logic, core Python concepts, and good coding practices through more complex exercises and problem-solving scenarios.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The topics listed below represent concepts studied and applied throughout the projects:

- **State Management & Integration:** Managing a shared global state (e.g., Bank Balance) across independent modules.
- **Advanced Financial Algorithms:** Implementation of "Greedy Algorithms" for ATM banknote distribution.
- **Data Persistence & Records:** Tracking global records (highest, lowest, cheapest) that persist across multiple sessions.
- **Numerical Precision:** Using `round()` and float handling to prevent precision errors in financial calculations.
- **Conditional logic and nested conditions:** Applied in Payment Managers, Data Analyzers, and Bank Systems.
- **Loops (for, while) and Control flow (break, continue):** Used for advanced command-based CLI interaction.
- **String manipulation and formatting:** Advanced f-strings for aligned tables and professional reports.
- **Input validation and Limiters:** Enforcing dynamic constraints (e.g., preventing withdrawals greater than balance).
- **Standard libraries:** Utilization of `random`, `math`, `time`, and `datetime`.
- **User Experience (UX):** Adding delays (`time.sleep`), professional interactive menus, and ANSI colors.
- **Lists, tuples, and dictionaries**
